This is my fork of lobster.

New stuff:

- An emacs major mode - see lobster/docs/emacs. Required a few minor
  changes to lobster to make it work nicely.

- Basic Box2D integration.

- Basic Bullet integration.

- Better handling of Win32 exceptions. (Not generally a problem in
  lobster, but my additions did suffer from them while still under
  development.)

- Various minor tweaks.

More to come...
